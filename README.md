# CrowdPressure
University project on pedestrian crowds movement. 
Simulation is mostly based on Helbing, Molnar, Farkas and Vicsek's "Simulation of Pedestrian Crowds in Normal and Evacuation Situations".

Agents interact with walls and one other. Crowd pressure of each agent is represented by proper colour (green/red).
