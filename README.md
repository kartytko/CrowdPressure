# CrowdPressure
### System modelling and simulation course, AGH UST 2018/2019.

University project on Crowd Pressure, which simulates movement of pedestrians in normal and panic situations. 

Simulation consists of few scenarios where pedestrians exit through bottleneck. Implementation was based on **Social Force** model introduced by **D. Helbing, P. Molnar, T. Vicsek and I. Farkas** in "Simulation of Pedestrains Crowds in Normal and Evacuation Situations", as well as on the modifications suggested by T. Lakoba, D. Kaup and N. Finkelstein.

An agent's interaction with obstacles (such as walls or other agents) and the current value of Social Forces are represented by corresponding colour (green/red) that showcases the change of crowd pressure.
